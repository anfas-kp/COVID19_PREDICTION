## Overview

COVID-19 has significantly impacted public health globally. Early detection of cases is crucial for effective containment and treatment. This project leverages patient-level data and machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of COVID-19 infection.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library
- **Pandas**: Data analysis and manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization libraries
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding environment

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anfas-kp/COVID19_PREDICTION.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd COVID19_PREDICTION
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate # For Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Launch the `COVID19_Prediction.ipynb` file.
3. Execute the cells to preprocess the data, train the models, and analyze results.
4. Customize the code to test additional algorithms or tune hyperparameters.

## Dataset

The dataset includes patient information, such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Symptoms
- Comorbidities
- Travel history

The data is preprocessed to address missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

## Model Performance

The project explores various machine learning algorithms, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

Model evaluation is based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust performance.
